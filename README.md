# 🗺️ Kaplayer: The Web-Based Map Designer for 2D Game Devs

Designing 2D levels shouldn't involve manual coordinate math. Kaplayer is an open-source, browser-based map editor that turns visual sprite based level design into ready-to-use code for web game engines.

## 🚀 Why Kaplayer?
- **Zero Setup:** No installation. Open your browser and start building.
- **Visual-First:** Select and paint your sprites onto a map grid.
- **Engine Ready:** One-click code copy for KaplayJS (with PhaserJS support coming soon).
- **Open Source:** Cusomizable for your own projects needs

## 🛠️ How it works:
1. Load your spritesheet & corresponding xml file.
2. Paint your level with intuitive grid tools.
3. Copy the generated code block for your engine
4. Paste directly into your project and watch your world come to life.

## 💿 Local Install
